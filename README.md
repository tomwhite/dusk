A program to plot the time of [dusk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusk) over the year for any given location on the
Earth's surface. Curves for official (0째 below horizon), civil (6째), nautical (12째), and astronomical (18째) dusk are
shown.

To run, first generate a data file as follows (you will need to change the lat/long parameters for other locations):

```bash
./fetch_crick.sh
python convert.py > target/data/crick.tsv
cp target/data/crick.tsv data.tsv
```

or, for San Francisco:

```bash
./fetch_sf.sh
python convert.py > target/data/sf.tsv
cp target/data/sf.tsv data.tsv
```

Next, run a local server:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

then visit http://localhost:8000/ to see the plot.

=== Java version ===

There's also a Java version, which may not be quite as accurate.

```bash
mvn -q exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.tom_e_white.dusk.Dusk > data.tsv
```
